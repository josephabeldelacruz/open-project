# open-project
This is an open book project for my sample apps and codes. I manage the whole project using the projects feature [here](https://github.com/parsetom/open-project/projects/1) and for **simplicity** this repository consists of multiple sample applications using branches. Check the links below for quick navigation of each master branch.

### Applications 
* [Portfolio UI via React](https://github.com/parsetom/open-project/tree/master-ui-react)
* [Portfolio Web API via .Net Core](https://github.com/parsetom/open-project/tree/master-api-netcore)
